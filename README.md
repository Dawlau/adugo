# Adugo

This is an [Adugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adugo) game developed with [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/) and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news).
The only difference between this and the original game is that in this version of the game, when the jaguar eats a dog it can make another move.

## Features

This game has 2 main parts: The homescreen and the actual game

### Homescreen

Here you can select what kind of player should control each type of piece(a human or an AI).
If you select the AI for a specific piece, you can also set the difficulty for the AI.

### The game

Here, you can either play with another human or an AI, or you can watch two AI's confront each other.
The game has a nice GUI, perfect for anyone that wants to try this old game.

Good luck!

Notes:

The AI was programmed using the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) and optimized using [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning).

## How to run

Run the run.sh script as follows:
```
./run.sh
```
